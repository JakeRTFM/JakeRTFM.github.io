title: Java ppc64le
---

When using Java on ppc64le (for exemple Power8 at runabove.com), you might get this error :

	The stack size specified is too small, Specify at least 768k
	Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
	Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.

Depending of the Java applications, you're trying to use, the Java stack size need more size on ppc64le.
To resolve the problem, we have to change the stack size for the running java with the command line : -XssSIZEk

For exemple : 

	java -Xss1664k JavaApplication
